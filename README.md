# Cotecna Material

This project contains the Cotecna Material (cm) library, forked from Nerero Material (nm) library, which aims to provide additional Material Design components that are not availble in Angular Material, at least, at the time of their creation. 

## Local Development

It is nothing else than an Angular project with Angular Material imported. In order to see and run the code locally, follow the steps below:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the dependencies using the `npm install` command from the terminal.
3. Serve it locally by running `ng serve`. 
4. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

Note that the library was created as an [Angular 6 CLI Library](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/wiki/stories-create-library). The library code is located inside of `projects/cm`.

## Demo Site Project
